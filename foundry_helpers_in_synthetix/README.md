##  Foundry Helpers in Synthetix

Some scripts I wrote to work in [synthetix-v3](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3). 

- `inspect.sh`: This uses `forge inspect` to scan storage layouts of some files.
- `build_remappings.sh`: This basically wrote mapping for some folders to hardhat shorthands, for foundry to use.
